Basic Instructions
==================
Slicing
-------
Find something cool you want to print! Checkout [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) or [cults3d](https://cults3d.com/en) or [yeggi](https://www.yeggi.com/)

Grab an .obj or .stl file from links above and slice it. The most popular Slicer being [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura)
- [ ] Configure Cura on your machine with Ender 3 as the 3D printer [Additional help here](http://www.emcu.eu/configure-ultimaker-cura-software-for-use-the-creality-3d-printer-model-ender-3/)

Next, drag your .stl or .obj to the Cura view.

Align, rotate and scale the object so that printing it makes sense.

Before slicing, configure the print settings. 0.2 Profile, 20% infill, and supports when needed

When you are ready, slice!

Once sliced, the printer will be able to read the file in a format that it would understand, gfile (basically time, position instructions for printer head). Save to the micro sd with a micro-sd-USB adapter. Once properly inserted into machine, Cura will intelligently see the SD card and give you the option to "Save to removable device. Click that!

Eject when finished and see you at the printer!

Acutally printing
-----------------
At this point, you should have a micro SD card loaded up with your object sliced (gfile format Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ )

Make sure that the black power cord in connected. Turn on the machine with the red switch on side. 
Once properly turned on, you should see this!

Insert the micro SD card into the lower left body of the printer!

You should see this when inserted!

Enter the printer's menu by pushing down on the round button.

Enter into the "Print from TF" menu.

Select your object and press the round button!

The printer starts by flushing the extruder. It makes a line on the left side of the build plate.

Once it's ready to print, it will create an outline around the bottom of the base of the object it's printing. You are off with printing!

ðŸš¨Things to watch for (IMPORTANT)ðŸš¨
==================================
In any of these cases, cut the power to the printer, IMMEDIATELY!
- [ ] Weird noises
- [ ] Stringy mess of plastic
- [ ] No more filament on the spool
- [ ] Extruder digging into build plate
- [ ] Anything that seems off....

Materials
=========
These materials are best for this printer.

* 1.75 PLA Plastic (Look for 1kg/$20 or better)

* ABS (make sure to set this as the material when slicing!!!!)

* PLA-Wood Hybrids 

## Loading up new filament
Before inserting or removing old filament, warm the extruder end. Prepare -> Prepare PLA

![Screen Shot 2021-03-14 at 8 32 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9064271/111092665-a8020480-8504-11eb-88e0-8b472e851ba9.png)

Once the extruder is warm, you can safely remove any previous filament.
Using blue angle cutters, cut the new filament at an angle to help with inserting through feeder and filament tube.

Pinch/Hold down the spring tensioner and snake through the hole, by the gear and into the tube. This step is sometimes difficult.
![Screen Shot 2021-03-14 at 8 27 02 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9064271/111092797-1646c700-8505-11eb-88eb-5e9e44805216.png)

If the extruder end if hot and ready, pushing the filament all the way through the filament tube and to the extruder end should give you string plastic.

You are done with loading new filament. Please clean any mess made!
